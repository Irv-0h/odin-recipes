    <h2>How to:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Cooking the Minced Meat</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>On a low-heat pan, add just enough oil to cover the pan.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Tip: Pour a small amount of oil and move the pan to and spread the oil. Repeat this until pan is completely covered </em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add the onions of your choosing to the pan. Allow the onions to sweat.</li>
            <li>Add dry herbs (Basil and Oregano) to cover the onions entirely. Use wooden spoon to stir the onions and mix the herbs. Add some more herbs to cover the onions again.</li>
            <li>Add the herbs to the onions. Both the dhanya, mixed herbs should cover the onions collectively. Stir the onions.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>(Optional):</em> If you have a beef spice or any meaty spice flavour. You're welcome to coat the onions and mix</li>
                </ul> 
            <li>Add a small amount of salt and generous amount of pepper to the onions.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>(Optional):</em> For a <strong>little</strong> extra kick, add paprika.</li>
                    <li><em>(Optional):</em> For a <strong> stronger </strong> extra kick, add cayenne pepper or chilli flakes.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you're new to strong spices: <em>Less is more!</em></li>
                        <li>IF you're not new, <em>do as you please.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul> 
                <li>Allow the onions to sweat and cook in the herbs and spices.</li>
            <li>Add the finell diced garlic cloves and mix well.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Disclaimer: There's technically no such thing as "too much" garlic, so to my garlic lovers, don't follow this step you should know how much is enough. You've got this!</em></li>
                </ul>
            <li>Add the canned tomatoes</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> <em>(Optional):</em> <strong>Include</strong> a diced tomato to add a fresher taste to the acidity.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Bring the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Once onions are translucent and tomato is softened add the minced meat to the pan and allow to fry.</li>
            <li>Stir frequently with wooden spoon</li>
            <li>Once the minced meat is brown, in smaller pieces and still firm when chewing, you're good! This part is done!</li>
            <li>Slowly add a little sugar to balance the acidity without making it too sweet.</li>
        </ol>
           
        <li><h3>White Sauce</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Disclaimer: This section is optional but does add a creamer flavour profile to the dish.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>To a low-heated sauce pan, add equal parts butter and sivved flour. i.e. 1:1 butter:flour</li>
            <li>Stir well to ensure a homogenous paste</li>
            <li>Slowly add milk and stir. At this point the pan can be at medium heat.</li>
            <li>The paste should dissolve into the milk. </li>
            <li>Continue adding milk until it is at a creamy consistency. This sholdn't be runny.</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt is welcomed. Feel free to add some dry herbs.</li>
            <li><em>(Optional):</em> To change the white sauce into a cheese sauce, add grated cheese of you choosing. Just enough to change the sauce's colour. </li>
                    
        </ol>
        <li><h3>Cooking Pasta Sheets </h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>On Medium heat on a saucier pan, cook the pasta sheeets until al dente in lightly salted water. </li>
            <li>Once cooked, drain the boiling water and run under cold water. This stops the cooking process. </li>       
        </ol>
        <li><h3>Let's roast</h3></li>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Remember: Tier order is: Cooked mince, pasta sheets, white sauce REPEAT. </em></li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a baking tray layer the minced meat, then pasta and white sauce. Repeat this until the very top.</li>
            <li>On the very top, add the mixture of grated cheeses you chose and again, feel free to season with dry and fresh herbs!</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180 degrees celcius.</li>
            <li>Add the oven tray into the oven and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If familiar with oven settings make sure that the over is being heat from the bottom only.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>    
    </ol>
