    <p>What's <strong>better</strong> than a winter's drink but <em>in the summer?</em></p>
    <p>What's <strong>better</strong> than constructing your desires <em>at home!?</em> </p>
    <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Since the dishes on this website are made with so much love <em>(and calories!!).</em> Let's make a drink that's caloric-conscious and easy to make at home!</p>
            <p>What's great about making iced coffee is: it's an opportunity to figure out exactly how you would like your caffeinated drink without breaking the bank.</p>
            <p>A <strong>Toast!</strong> Let's raise our <em>cold brewskies</em> to the <em>broskies</em> (and <em>girlskies</em> and <em>folkskies</em>) that can't start their morning without their coffee!</p>     
    <h2>What's Needed?</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Coffee of your choosing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For this recipe, instant coffee will be used. <em>Try and ensure your instant coffee's ingredients list <strong>does not</strong> contain chicory for a fuller experience.</em></li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            <em>(Chicory does have its nutritional perks, and may affect the taste).</em>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                       <em> Hot and Cold</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Liquid and Solid</em>

             </ul>
              
        <h3>Utensils</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 - 3 Ice Trays</li>
                <li>Cup or glass of your choosing</li>
                <li>Kettle</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>How to:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Ice Block prep</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Add cold water into  an ice tray and store in the freezer.</li> 
         </ol>
         <li><h3>Coffee-Ice Block prep</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a cup, prepare the dry ingredients for a cup of instant coffee.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>If you're using sweetner or any syrups then add this too.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Now add 10 mls of boiled water from the kettle into the cup.</li>
            <li>Pick up the cup and swirl to cause a whirlpool.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>This should allow for the ingredients to dissolve. Using a teaspoon to stir works too.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Using cold- or room temperature water fill the cup and stir.</li>
            <li>If the temperature of the coffee is at room temperature or colder, decant this coffee into the remaining iced trays and store in the freezer.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Repeat steps 1 - 3 to make coffee-ice block in stock. Making batches saves time downstream.</em></li>
            </ul>
         </ol>
           
        <li><h3>Making the Iced Brew</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Once the ice - and coffee-ice blocks are formed we can making our brew!</li>
            <li>Start off by doing steps 1 - 4 from the "2. Coffee-Ice Block Prep". <em>(When you get to step 4, don't completely fill the cup.)</em></li>        
            <ul>
                <li>Here's a recap:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a cup, prepare the dry ingredients for a cup of instant coffee.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>If you're using sweetner or any syrups then add this too.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Now add 10 mls of boiled water from the kettle into the cup.</li>
                        <li>Pick up the cup and swirl to cause a whirlpool.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>This should allow for the ingredients to dissolve. Using a teaspoon to stir works too.</em></li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Using cold- or room temperature water fill (fill between 1/2-way - 3/4-way, depending on your milk/cream preferences and how strong you want the brew.) the cup and stir.</li>
                    </ol>
            </ul>
            <li>Add 2 - 3 of your coffee-iced blocks</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>This will prevent the dilution in flavour as the "normal" ice melts.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fill cup with ice blocks if drinking milk - and cream free! Otherwise add ice blocks and whilst leaving room to add your remaining milk/cream of choice.</li>
            <li>Top up with sweetner/syrup if craving a sugary-kick!</li>
        </ol>    
        </ol>
    </ol>
