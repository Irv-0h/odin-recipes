    <h2>How to:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Fresh Ingredients</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Separate lettuce leaves and then clean/rinse the lettuce with water and/or lemon juice and store for later. <em>Leaving the lettuce in lemon juice will help retain its crunchiness.</em> </li>
            <li>Slice tomatoes using either of the knives. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the tomato slices and store for later. </li>
            <ol>
                <li><em>(Optional: Dice 1 tomato in to cubes.)</em></li> 
            </ol>
            <li>Slice onions using either of the knives. Ringlets or half rings would be ideal. Store for later.</li>
            <li>Peel potatoes using the potato peeler (or a knife). Then using a knife, cut "french fry" slices to the width and length of your choosing. Store for later.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><h3>Frying the Steak</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the defrosted steak and cut it into thin slices.</li>
            <li> Coat steak in masala, dhanya, mixed herbs, pepper, paprika and pinch of salt. Add a small dollop of oil. Rub the spices into the steak and store for later.</li>
            <li>On a low-heat pan, add just enough oil to cover the pan.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Tip: Pour a small amount of oil and move the pan to and spread the oil. Repeat this until pan is completely covered </em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add the onions of your choosing to the pan. Allow the onions to sweat.</li>
            <li>Add masala spice to cover the onions entirely. Use wooden spoon to stir the onions and mix the spice. Add some more masala spice to cover the onions again.</li>
            <li>Add the herbs to the onions. Both the dhanya, mixed herbs should cover the onions collectively. Stir the onions.</li> 
            <li>Add a small amount of salt and generous amount of pepper and paprika to the onions.</li>
            <li>Allow the onions to sweat and cook in the herbs and spices.</li>
            <li>Add 1 - 2 tsp of crushed garlic and mix well.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Disclaimer: There's technically no such thing as "too much" garlic, so to my garlic lovers, don't follow this step you should know how much is enough. You've got this!</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li><em>(Optional)</em>: Add the diced tomatoes to the pan and allow to soften</li>
            <li>Bring the heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Add the steak to the pan and allow to fry</li>
            <li>Stir frequently with wooden spoon</li>
            <li>If the pan is drying at any point add a small dollop of water to maintain a saucy consistency.</li>
            <li>Store for later.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><h3>Deep-Frying the Chips</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li><em>(Optional)Cook potato slices in warm water until soft</em></li>
            <li>Fill the saucier pan to halfway with oil and heat oil at medium heat.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Use preferably canola or sunflower oil, or any oil with a higher evaporating point to prevent the oil from burning and ruining the chips.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Take one chip slice nd cautious add to pot. Step away to ensure no splash-back and check for bubbling around potato slice.</li>
            <li>Once splash-zone is reduced add a generous amount of potato slices. Make sure all slices are covered in oil. Rather fry the slices in batches instead of all-at-once.</li>
            <li>With a fork or knife poke a slice. If it goes through with no resistence the chips are done.</li>
            <li>If seeking crispy chips wait until golden brown before removing.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 - 6 until all batches are complete. </li>
            <li><em>(Mandatory but optional) Add a healthy amount of salt over the chips as well as coating the chips in vinegar</em>.</em></li>
        </ol>
        <li><h3>Let's Construct Gatsby</h3></li>
        <ol>
            <li>With a bread knife cut the roll of your choosing horizontally</li>
            <ul>
                <li><em> You can keep the roll connected or cut the roll right through. It's all up to you.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add the letters to the bottom-lid of the roll. You shouldn't be able to see any bread.</li>
            <li>Add the ring sliced tomato evenly over the lettuce.</li>
            <li>Now layer the deep fried potato chips.</li>
            <li>On top of the chips, comes the masala steak!</li>
            <li>Close the roll with the top-lid and half the gatsby for 2!</li>
            <li>You may also add a sauce of your choosing, here are some of Cape Town's favourites:</li>
                <ul>

                    <li>Tomato sauce</li>

                </ul>
